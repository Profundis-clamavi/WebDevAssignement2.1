            <h2>Do dogs know their name?</h2>
            <p>Dogs can recognize their names, but they don’t know their names the way humans understand them. Dogs
                recognize the sound of their name and respond to it accordingly. Dogs understand their names much the
                same way babies do. Dogs process language in a similar way that humans do, using both sides of their
                brain to understand body language, tone of voice, and context clues4. Dogs perceive their names as a
                command rather than identification.</p>

            <h2>Essential tips to raise healthy pets</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Limit human foods. Too many table scraps can lead to weight gain. Be extra careful about people
                        foods like chocolate, grapes, raisins, garlic, and macadamia nuts, which are toxic to pets.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Don’t overdo supplements. Most are not well-studied in animals. Ask your vet before you give your
                        pet any supplement.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>See a behavior specialist. Veterinary behaviorists can help with issues like separation anxiety,
                        aggressiveness, or excessive fear.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Pay attention to your pet’s cues. Let your dog or cat tell you what makes them happy, whether
                        that’s
                        a belly rub or some extra space.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why does my dog attack me?</h2>
            <p>Although it may seem like your dog is biting you aggressively or showing other aggressive behaviors out
                of the blue, most dogs only exhibit aggressive behavior for one of five basic reasons: Your dog is ill,
                frightened, possessive, showing dominance, or frustrated.</p>

            <h2>How to throw a birthday party for your dog</h2>
            <p>Pick a Date and Place: Choosing the right date and venue sets the foundation for your party. It ensures
                convenience for you and your guests and provides a safe and enjoyable environment for the dogs.

                Plan Activities: Organizing fun and engaging activities ensures that both dogs and humans have a great
                time. It keeps the party lively and memorable for everyone involved.

                Safety First: Ensuring the safety of all the dogs at the party is paramount. Supervision, access to
                water, and shade, as well as monitoring for signs of stress or aggression, are essential to guarantee a
                successful and incident-free celebration.</p>
